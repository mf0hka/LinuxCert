Certification questions for the Linux+ exam
I am going for my Linux+ certification, and I need to study. I have been using Linux for a long time now, but I find some
of the exam questions hard to answer, becuase its the comptia answers, not the actual detailed answer we all desire.
So my plan is to draft both example and realistic questions from expirience, and try to make a study guide/ quiz for persons
like me, in a similar situation. I took a Linux+ certification course, at a local university, and it was absolutely awful. 

future code will likely take the form of a shell script, or as some web based language, such as PHP or JS.
I dont care if users cheat, the goal is to pass the certification exam.
